### Target personas
These are initial "personas" - we realize they are not fully fleshed out full personas, but we have not done the initial user experience work to interview, but we wanted to make sure we kept some of these in mind.

1. Juan - An end user that likes to use help and needs it.

2. Carmen - End user that is both a primarily Spanish speaker and legally blind (20/250 vision)

3. Yvette - Technical writer - mostly for help systems. Does contract work.

4. Corvette, Ltd. - the super-small company - One to 3 dev team doing their own support. Probably doesn't have huge money piles nor the need to support large support systems.

5. Jean - Support staff

6. Carl - Support manager

7. Dutch - Developer in larger organization.
