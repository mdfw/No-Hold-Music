  "body": "## No Hold Music - Apple Help Book\r\n\r\nNo Hold Music - Apple Help Book edition is a replacement for Apple's built-in help system. It is \"API inspired\" in as much as it tries to be somewhat near to the way the Apple Help Book system works while bringing it up to date and in-process instead of a separate app/process/whatever it is.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Use existing help books with minor changes. \r\n* Multiple language books supported.\r\n* Many insertion points to customize.\r\n* Fully marked header files for ease of use from Swift.\r\n\r\n## NOTE\r\n\r\n**This is under active development and is not finished at the time of this writing (8 Jun 2016).**\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nSince it's not finished, it is not licensed for re-use yet.",
